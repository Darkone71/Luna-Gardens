		<h2>How we got our start</h2>
		<p>The name and idea for 'The Garden Witch' was born from my delightful mind while I was working in a local garden center, as a plant merchandiser. My co-worker, being so short, I referred to him as the Garden Gnome, so I named myself the Garden Witch! After recieving certificates in small business, sustainable agriculture, web page design, and graphic arts, I planned out my business model and went for it! Now, here we are many years later, continually improving our business with our wonderful patrons in mind.</p>

		<h2>A bit about our delicious food and beverages!</h2>
		<p>Nature gets it right, so we get it from nature. The ingredients we use in our cafe is eco-certified and loved, from seed to plate. We take pride in getting the ingredients for our cafe, from the food grown onsite, and from local farmers. We are dedicated to creating healthy, delicious menu options for our guests. We continue to research and learn everything we can to assist you in making choices beneficial to you and your family, and strive to be a source of inspiration and guidance for anyone considering sourcing and processing their own food. We are working towards expanding our cafe menu to offer more gluten free and vegan choices. We’re all about real food that’s fresh, ecological, and sustainable.</p>
